       <span ID="myID">At the Zoo </span>
        <br> First I saw the white bear, 
        <br>then I saw the black;
        <br>Then I saw the camel with a hump upon his back;
        <br>Then I saw the grey wolf, with mutton in his maw;
        <br>Then I saw the wombat waddle in the straw;
        <br>Then I saw the elephant a-waving of his trunk;
        <br>Then I saw the monkeys, mercy, how unpleasantly they smelt!
        <br />
        <br>â€” William Makepeace Thackeray
